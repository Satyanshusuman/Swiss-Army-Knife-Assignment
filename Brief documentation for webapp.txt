Following are the brief steps that i would go through while making webapp:-

1.) First i Set up a Django project and create a Django app.

2.) I define url for view class for load and extract.

3.)In this Django app's views.py file i imported the necessary libraries like(render,pandas,view) and make view class with get and post function for get and post request.

4.)In get request i simply render a form with input file box and upload button .button will hit post request and apply post function of views.py

5.) In post request first i get requested file from client side then findout file path and then extract data using previous script which is kept in views.py of script app.

6.) finally convert that data into dataframe and then this dataframe into html table and pass this html table as context while rendering extract.html template.
